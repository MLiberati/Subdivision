Supplementary materials for Liberati et al (2019) "Subdivision for conservation?"

Algorithm scripts are written in Python and use the 'inspyred' model developed by A. Garrett (https://pythonhosted.org/inspyred/). The algorithm also interfaces and requires a license with ESRI's ArcGIS software (version 10.5).

Subdivision was simulated by adapting a vector-based automated subdivision process for irregular parcels developed by Dahal & Chow (2014). 

Figures are written in R and use the ggplot2 package.
